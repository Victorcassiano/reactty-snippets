# Simple React Snippets with Typescript

The essential collection of React Snippets and commands.

## Features

Only what you need and nothing more. **No Redux. No React Native.**

Simply, simple React snippets.

These snippets were selected carefully from my own day-to-day React use. Not
everything in React is included here. This is a hand selected set of snippets
that work the way that you would expect, not just a copy of the documentation.

## Snippets

| Snippet | Renders      |

## Full Expansions
