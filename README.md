# Reactty Snippets

The essential collection of React Snippets and commands.

## Features

Simply, simple React snippets.

These snippets were selected carefully from my own day-to-day React use. Not
everything in React is included here. This is a hand selected set of snippets
that work the way that you would expect, not just a copy of the documentation.

## Snippets

| Snippet | Renders                               |
| ------- | ------------------------------------- |
| `imr`   | Import React                          |
| `imrn`  | Import React end React-Native         |
| `imrs`  | Import React, { useState }            |
| `imrse` | Import React, { useState, useEffect } |
| `fcwi`  | Import React, { useState, useEffect } |
| `fc`    | Function Syntax Component             |
| `uef`   | useEffect Hook                        |
